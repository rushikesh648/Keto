Keto Meal Binary EncodingThis encoding translates the macronutrient profile of a ketogenic meal into a simple 8-bit sequence, where each bit corresponds to a rule from the Keto Binary Code.The Encoded Meal: Ribeye Steak, Butter, and AsparagusComponentPrimary MacronutrientKeto RuleBinary DigitRibeye SteakProtein & FatInclude (Rule 1)1ButterFatInclude (Rule 1)1AsparagusLow-Net Carb VegInclude (Rule 1)1Buns/Rice (Hypothetical Exclusion)High CarbExclude (Rule 0)0Fries/Potatoes (Hypothetical Exclusion)High CarbExclude (Rule 0)0Dessert/Sugar (Hypothetical Exclusion)High CarbExclude (Rule 0)0Healthy Fat Source 2 (e.g., Olive Oil)FatInclude (Rule 1)1Protein Source 2 (e.g., Cheese)Protein & FatInclude (Rule 1)1The Keto Meal Binary Code1110 0011InterpretationBits 1-3 (111): The meal is composed of the correct macronutrients (Steak, Butter, Asparagus).Bits 4-6 (000): The crucial exclusions are in place: no starch, grains, or sugar are present. This ensures carb count is low.Bits 7-8 (11): Confirmation that additional protein and fat sources (the required fuel) are prioritized.The full binary sequence 1110 0011 represents a successful ketogenic meal that is low-carb and high-fat/protein.
