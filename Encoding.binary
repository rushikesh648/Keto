here8-Bit Keto Encoding Standard (KES-8)This conceptual standard hard-codes the fundamental rules and food categories for achieving and maintaining ketosis, using 8-bit binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representations.1. Macronutrient Goals (The Fuel Set)These codes define the primary goal percentages for staying in ketosis. Rule: Prioritize 1xx-1xx codes.| Concept | Decimal | Hex | 8-Bit Binary | Description || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || FAT (Default Fuel) | 200 | C8 | 1100 1000 | The primary energy source (70-75% of calories). || PROTEIN (Structure) | 160 | A0 | 1010 0000 | Essential for muscle maintenance (20-25% of calories). || CARBS (Limit) | 020 | 14 | 0001 0100 | Max net carb limit (typically 20g-50g per day). |2. Key Food Groups (The 'GO' Codes)These codes represent foods that are safe and encouraged on the keto diet.
